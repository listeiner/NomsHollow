            <h3>Gumi</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Description</strong>: Gumi is a fiery daredevil and
              scavenger who enjoys hunting for treasure and gambling.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Species</strong>: Syrian Hamster</p>
            <p><strong>Age</strong>: Young Adult</p>
            <p><strong>Gender</strong>: Female</p>
            <p><strong>Habitat</strong>: Nom's Hollow</p>
            <p><strong>Occupation</strong>: Scavenger</p>
            <p>
              <strong>Personality</strong>: Energetic, hot-tempered,
              strong-willed, adventurous, and outgoing but also kind and
              reliable

            <p>
              <strong>Background</strong>: Gumi's burrow was originally in an
              area that was overrun by beasts and all of her loot and treasured

              keep her stash safe, and that's how she found Nom's Hollow. Along
              the way, she made some friends and learned to share the 'glory of
              the loot' with her friends.
